# Electron Simple ToDo App

This is a very simple version of an electron todo app. The purpose wasn't to build a real app; it was to explore the combination of some technologies. The result could be a good start for an Electron project with a merge of the following:

- The [Microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter)

- The [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) source

- Merged in [Stephen Grider's todo code](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ElectronCode/tree/master/completed_code/todos) from his [Electron for Desktop Apps: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/electron-react-tutorial/) Udemy course

- Eslint for TypeScript with recommended rules from the @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin. That said, didn't really care about cleaning up code much for this so was relaxed with the rules.

- Prettier support

- Jest for testing (only one dummy test exists)
